# Graph Analytics on GPU


GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) are widely used for parallel computing tasks due to their architecture, which is highly efficient for tasks involving cohesive computation. Here are the main reasons why GPUs excel in such tasks:

1. **Parallel Processing Capabilities**: GPUs contain hundreds or thousands of smaller cores designed for parallel processing. This allows them to perform many operations simultaneously, making them ideal for tasks that can be divided into smaller, independent operations.

2. **High Throughput**: The architecture of a GPU is optimized for high throughput of data-intensive computations. This is particularly beneficial for applications involving large data sets, such as machine learning algorithms, where the same operation needs to be performed on many data points.


3. **Memory Bandwidth**: GPUs have higher memory bandwidth compared to CPUs, allowing for faster data transfer rates. This is crucial for cohesive computation tasks that require large amounts of data to be loaded into memory quickly.
